--- README ---
Simply download and include the Sphero-Desktop-API-<Version>.jar in your IDE environment
to use the API. The ZIP file available at github provides both the .jar file and
the available javadoc for the current compiled version of the API.

There are no real time atm. to write a in-depth readme for the usage of this
library. I've created a small example application that connects to an available
Sphero device and then sends some basic commands. This example is located in:

Happy coding!
